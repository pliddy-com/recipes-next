## Next Steps

There is currently a project backlog of approximately 25 stories identifying new features, enhancements to existing features, or technical improvements. The prioritized backlog items for next steps include:

- Adding routing functionality for unknown urls to a 404 page

- Enhancing the existing content for improved SEO performance identified by the Checkbot scans

- Adding recipe schemas from <a href="https://schema.org/Recipe" target="_blank">schema.org</a> to the page head in order to enable display of Google search results as rich snippets

- Implementing lazy loading of Next.js components to improve initial page load performance on mobile devices

- Creating infrastructure-as-code deployment scripts using the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/home.html" target="_blank">AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)</a> to enable just-in-time creation of identical feature branch environments for testing

- Implementing Algolia for site search

- Adding additional content types to Contentful for articles and featured landing pages that aggregate content of multiple types

- Enabling creation and editing of recipe content through the UI by leveraging GraphQL transforms and the Contentful content API
