npm warn deprecated @types/next@9.0.0: This is a stub types definition. next provides its own type definitions, so you do not need this installed.
npm warn deprecated inflight@1.0.6: This module is not supported, and leaks memory. Do not use it. Check out lru-cache if you want a good and tested way to coalesce async requests by a key value, which is much more comprehensive and powerful.
npm warn deprecated flatten@1.0.3: flatten is deprecated in favor of utility frameworks such as lodash.
npm warn deprecated @humanwhocodes/config-array@0.13.0: Use @eslint/config-array instead

npm warn deprecated abab@2.0.6: Use your platform's native atob() and btoa() methods instead
npm warn deprecated are-we-there-yet@4.0.2: This package is no longer supported.
npm warn deprecated @humanwhocodes/object-schema@2.0.3: Use @eslint/object-schema instead
npm warn deprecated glob@7.1.7: Glob versions prior to v9 are no longer supported
npm warn deprecated domexception@4.0.0: Use your platform's native DOMException instead
npm warn deprecated querystring@0.2.0: The querystring API is considered Legacy. new code should use the URLSearchParams API instead.
npm warn deprecated mkdirp@0.3.0: Legacy versions of mkdirp are no longer supported. Please update to mkdirp 1.x. (Note that the API surface has changed to use Promises in 1.x.)
npm warn deprecated gauge@5.0.2: This package is no longer supported.
npm warn deprecated node-domexception@1.0.0: Use your platform's native DOMException instead
