[Warning at /RecipesBranchStackProd] Be aware that the NodeJS runtime of Node 16 will be deprecated by Lambda on June 12, 2024. 
Lambda runtimes Node 18 and higher include SDKv3 and not SDKv2. Updating your Lambda runtime will require bundling the SDK, 
or updating all SDK calls in your handler code to use SDKv3 (which is not a trivial update). Please account for this added complexity 
and update as soon as possible. 

[ack: aws-cdk-lib/aws-lambda-nodejs:runtimeUpdateSdkV2Breakage]

[Info at /RecipesBranchStackProd/originRequest] Removed AWS_NODEJS_CONNECTION_REUSE_ENABLED environment variable for Lambda@Edge compatibility

[Warning at /RecipesBranchStackProd/SiteDistribution/Origin1] Cannot update bucket policy of an imported bucket. You will need to update the policy manually instead.

See the "Setting up OAI with imported S3 buckets (legacy)" section of module's README for more info.
